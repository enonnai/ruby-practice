## My Ruby exercises
### This repository contains my solutions to ruby coding challenges taken from *Chris Pine* and *Ruby Kickstart*:

For the first Ruby week at Makers Academy precouse, I decided to take on *Learn Ruby the Hard Way*, (please see repo called **lrthw**). Hence, after its completion, I decided to have a go at the other two and there we go! Hope you like my solutions :)

# New entry: kata
### Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition

Please find my tests and code for Ruby katas from www.codewars.com :)
