# Ruby-practice

This repository contains my solutions to Ruby coding challenges.

### *Chris Pine* and *Ruby Kickstart*:

For the first Ruby week at Makers Academy Pre-course, I decided to take on *Learn Ruby the Hard Way*, (feel free to check my [lrthw](https://github.com/enonnai/lrthw) repo). After its completion, I decided to have a go at the other two and there we go! Hope you like my solutions :)

### *Kata*

I wrote both tests and code for my kata challenges. What is a kata? Explanation from [Codewars](www.codewars.com):
> Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

### Dependencies
