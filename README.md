## My Ruby exercises
### This repository contains my solutions to ruby coding challenges taken from *Chris Pine* and *Ruby Kickstart*:

For the first Ruby week at Makers Academy precouse, I decided to take on *Learn Ruby the Hard Way*, (please see repo called **lrthw**). Hence, after its completion, I decided to have a go at the other two and there we go! Hope you like my solutions :)
