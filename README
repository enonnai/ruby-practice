## My ruby exercises  

### This repository contains my solutions to some ruby coding challenges taken from both Chris Pine and Ruby Kickstart. For the first Ruby week at Makers Academy precouse, I decided to take on Learn Ruby the Hard Way, (please see repo called 'lrthw') hence after its completion I decided to have a go at the other two and there we go! Hope you like my solutions :)
